Protocol Title:  <strong>Communication and social cognition in natural audiovisual
contexts </strong><br>
IRB# <strong>77226</strong><br>
<strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> You are invited to participate in a research study about language and
communication. The purpose of the research is to understand how you interact and
communicate with other people in naturalistic settings as a fluent English speaker. This
research will be conducted through the Prolific platform, including participants from the
US, UK, and Canada. If you decide to participate in this research, you will play a
communication game in a group with one or more partners.<br>
<strong>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</strong> The task will last the amount of time advertised on Prolific. You
are free to withdraw from the study at any time.<br>
<strong>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</strong> You may become frustrated if your partner gets distracted, or
experience discomfort if other participants in your group send text that is inappropriate
for the task. We ask you to please be respectful of other participants you might be
interacting with to mitigate these risks. You may also experience discomfort when being
asked to discuss or challenge emotionally salient political beliefs. Study data will be
stored securely, in compliance with Stanford University standards, minimizing the risk of
confidentiality breach. This study advances our scientific understanding of how people
communication and collaborate in naturalistic settings. This study may lead to further
insights about what can go wrong in teamwork, suggest potential interventions to
overcome these barriers, and help to develop assistive technologies that collaborate with
human partners. <strong>We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will
receive any benefits from this study.</strong><br>
<strong>PAYMENTS:</strong> You will receive payment in the amount advertised on Prolific. If you do not
complete this study, you will receive prorated payment based on the time that you have
spent. Additionally, you may be eligible for bonus payments as described in the
instructions.<br>
<strong>PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS:</strong> If you have read this form and have decided to participate in
this project, please understand <strong>your participation is voluntary</strong> and you have the <strong>right
to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without
penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative
is not to participate.</strong> You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. The
results of this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or
published in scientific journals. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published
and written data resulting from the study. In accordance with scientific norms, the data
from this study may be used or shared with other researchers for future research (after
removing personally identifying information) without additional consent from you.<br>
<strong>CONTACT INFORMATION: Questions:</strong> If you have any questions, concerns or
complaints about this research, its procedures, risks and benefits, contact the Protocol
Director, Robert Hawkins (rdhawkins@stanford.edu, 217-549-6923).<br>

or if you have any concerns, complaints, or general questions about the research or your
rights as a participant, please contact the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB) to
